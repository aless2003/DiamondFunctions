# Welcome

So, Welcome to my C Function Libary, first a little bit about me, I'm a 16 year old HTL-Student, a Otaku and a really weird person :D. 
In the moment, I write that, I learn Programming, so I wanted to make a Libary for the things I learn and then I thinked "Someone could help that maybe" and decided to upload it to github and here it is now.
So here is DiamondFunctions the C Libary.



# DiamondFunctions
Eine Funktion Sammlung f√ºr C (W.I.P)

# Fuctions:
`deleteSpace(char[])` wants a String (char Array) and Delete every Space Character in the String.

`Copyright(void)` doesn't need anything, just prints my Profile Picture and my Name :D

`checkFile(FILE *fp)` expect to get a FILE Pointer and checks if the File exists the Pointer is pointing to. returns a bool variable(true = File exist, false = File doesn't exist)

`selectionSort(int Array[], int size)`, `insertionSort(int Array[], int size)` and `bubbleSort(int Array[], int size)` expecting an int Array and the size of the Array. They will sort the Array from low to big (bsp. 1, 8, 19,...). Inform yourself which sort Algorithm is the best for your use.

`stringToUpper(char Letters[])` needs a String of Letters and if there is a small letter (bsp. a, x, t, ...) it will converted to a big letter (bsp. A, X, T, ...).
